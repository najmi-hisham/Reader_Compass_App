It's a great choice for inspiring creativity and imagination.

        1. "Hello Ruby: Journey Inside the Computer" by Linda Liukas - deep learning, children's, technology
                - This interactive book introduces young readers to the world of technology, including the basics of deep learning, through a playful story and engaging activities.
        2. "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn (Thriller, Mystery) - This gripping psychological thriller follows the sudden disappearance of Amy Dunne and the subsequent investigation into her vanishing. Told from alternating perspectives, this novel is filled with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. The complex characters and layered storytelling make "Gone Girl" a compelling read for thriller enthusiasts.
